# Welcome to your first day at Acme, Inc.

We realize you were probably expecting some sort of new hire orientation, but you are in training so we figured you didn't need it.

Performance reviews are due next week and all of our managers are complaining that they don't know how to write a review. Can you put together a quick 2 hour class for tomorrow's manager meeting to help them get started?

Forget all of that stuff you learned in about HPI and just write a class on basic principles of performance reviews.
